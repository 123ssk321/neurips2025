# Datasets

This directory contains the datasets used in the paper.

**Synthetic Datasets**: BA-Shapes (node classification), Tree-Grid(node classification), BA-2motif (graph classification), BA-Shapes-Link (link prediction), Tree-Grid-Link (link prediction). There 10 versions of each dataset, with different standard deviations for the artificially sampled node features. Naming convention: `dataset_nameX.pth`, where `X` is the standard deviation.

**Real Datasets**: MUTAG (graph classification).
